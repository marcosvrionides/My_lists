<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<p>
    To create a new task, you can tap on the "+ NEW" button, this will take you to the "new task
    page".
    <br>
    On the "new task page" you must enter:
<li>The task name</li>
<li>Create a new tag or chose one of your pre existing tags from the dropdown</li>
<li>If you want to be reminded, you can select a due date which will send you a notification at 9am
    on your chosen date.
</li>
<br>
Once you have entered the task details, tap on create to add the task to the list.
<br><br>
If you want to cancel, tap your device's back button to go to the previous screen.

    The top half of the main screen shows your uncompleted tasks grouped by their tag. When you tap
    on one of the tags a new page opens with a list of all tasks that have been assigned that tag.
<li>At the top left of the new screen you can see the current tag.</li>
<li>Each task can be tapped to be marked as complete.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the screen there is a button which takes you to another page where you can add
    an item with the current tag, or you can chose a different tag if you want.
</li>

    When you mark a task as completed, that task will now be shown in the "completed tasks" segment
    and not in the tasks screen.
    <br><br>
    You can tap the "CLEAR" button to delete all your completed tasks.
